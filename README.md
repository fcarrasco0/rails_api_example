  **OBS: this last one is not implemented right in this project yet.**


  ### Tests
  The file used for some tests is found in spec/requests/books_spec.rb and spec/integration/books_spec.rb (this last one for generating the swagger doc with rswag)

  To execute the tests use the command `bundle exec rspec spec/requests/books_spec.rb` inside the project's folder.

  ### Database Seeder

# Getting Started
In this project we will be working with a book collection and a book object.
The book object has the following attributes:
```json
 "book" {
	  "title": "Type: String",
	  "description": "Type: String",
	  "author": "Type: String",
	  "publisher": "Type: String",
	  "release_date": "type: yyyy-mm-dd",
	  "genre": "Type: String",
	  "edition": "Type: Integer",
	  "created_at": "type: timestamps",
	  "updated_at": "type: timestamps"
  }
```

## Running the project

Cloning the project on the selected folder:
    `git clone https://github.com/fcarrasco0/rails_api_example.git`

Next go inside the folder and execute the following command:
`bundle install`

After the installation has finished run: `rails server` and you will be able to access the project via `http://localhost:3000` for local testings.

## Endpoints

### List All Books
To list all books on the database simple make a request to:

```
example of response:

```json

  }
]
```

### List All Books Sorted by Attribute
It is possible to get an ordered list sorted by all book's attributes except for `description`. 
To do so, use the following URI:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/orderBy/attribute
```
example of response for `GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/orderBy/title`:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 6,
    "title": "A Many-Splendoured Thing",
    "description": "Ipsum deleniti rem delectus adipisci.",
    "author": "Dr. Rubin Okuneva",
    "publisher": "Dark Horse",
    "genre": "Horror",
    "release_date": "2020-04-17",
    "edition": 4,
    "created_at": "2020-01-18T19:37:05.814Z",
    "updated_at": "2020-01-18T19:37:05.814Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 16,
    "title": "An Evil Cradling",
    "description": "Deleniti accusamus eum quisquam facilis.",
    "author": "Selina Kris MD",
    "publisher": "Sidgwick & Jackson",
    "genre": "Fiction narrative",
    "release_date": "2020-03-19",
    "edition": 5,
    "created_at": "2020-01-18T19:37:07.274Z",
    "updated_at": "2020-01-18T19:37:07.274Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 21,
    "title": "Dark Tower II",
    "description": null,
    "author": "Stephen King",
    "publisher": "Dark Horse",
    "genre": "Horror",
    "release_date": "2019-03-10",
    "edition": 1,
    "created_at": "2020-01-19T12:52:41.330Z",
    "updated_at": "2020-01-19T12:52:41.330Z"
  }, ...
]
```

if you try to sort by description you will get the following response:
```json
{
  "message": "Description is not a valid request order.",
  "status": 400
}
```

### Get a single book
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/id
```

example of response for `GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/1`:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Surprised by Joy",
  "description": "Et dolor repudiandae corporis deleniti.",
  "author": "Stephen King",
  "publisher": "Etruscan Press",
  "genre": "Fantasy",
  "release_date": "2020-10-02",
  "edition": 2,
  "created_at": "2020-01-18T19:37:05.107Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-01-18T19:37:05.107Z"
}
```
**You have to make the request with a valid id, otherwise you will get the following message:**

```json
{
  "error": "Book not found. Please check the id requested."
}
```

### Create a new book
To create a new book you must make a request to the following URI
```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/
```
The body of the request must contain the book's attributes and respective values.
The **`'title', 'author', 'publisher'`** and **`'genre'`** attributes are necessary to create a new book. Also the `'author'`need to be at least 5 characters long and `'title'` and `'genre'` need to have at least 3 characters.
Example of a valid request body:
```json
  {
	  "title": "Book Title",
	  "author": "Book Author",
	  "publisher": "Book Publisher",
	  "release_date": "yyyy-mm-dd",
	  "genre": "Book Genre",
	  "edition": 1
  }
```
The response for the successful request is:
```json
{
  "id": 23,
  "title": "Book Title",
  "description": null,
  "author": "Book Author",
  "publisher": "Book Publisher",
  "genre": "Book Genre",
  "release_date": null,
  "edition": 1,
  "created_at": "2020-01-19T22:34:21.948Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-01-19T22:34:21.948Z"
}
```

If any of the requisites for the request is not met, an error messsage will be received: 
```json
{
  "title": [
    "can't be blank",
    "is too short (minimum is 3 characters)"
  ],
  "author": [
    "can't be blank",
    "is too short (minimum is 5 characters)"
  ],
  "publisher": [
    "can't be blank"
  ],
  "genre": [
    "can't be blank",
    "is too short (minimum is 3 characters)"
  ]
}
```

### Update Book
```
PUT http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/id
```
To update a book make a request passing the attribute you wish to change in the body of the request, for example updating the `description` of the previous example using 
`PUT http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/23` and body containing:
```json
{
    "description": "updated the book description"
}
```
The successful response is:
```json
{
  "id": 23,
  "description": "updated the book description",
  "title": "Book Title",
  "author": "Book Author",
  "publisher": "Book Publisher",
  "genre": "Book Genre",
  "release_date": null,
  "edition": 1,
  "created_at": "2020-01-19T22:34:21.948Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-01-19T23:17:37.425Z"
}
```
**Like in the `Get a single book` example the id requested must exist, otherwise you will the same error message from that example.**

### Delete Book
```
DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/id
```
This will delete a book with a valid id recorded in the database.
If the request is sucessful, you will receive the following response:
```json
{
  "message": "Book destroyed with success!"
}
```
Like `Get a single book` and `Update book` cases, if the requested id is invalid you will receive the same error message for this.

### Get all authors, genres or publishers
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/groupBy/type
```
To recover all authors, genres or publisher recorded in the database you should replace the `type` in the URI by one of the following `[author, genre, publisher]`.
For example if I request `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/groupBy/author` the response will be:

```json
[
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Charlene Raynor"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Deneen McCullough"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Donald Lesch"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Dorsey Littel"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Dr. Rubin Okuneva"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Edgar Barrows"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Hilario Marquardt"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Huey Sawayn V"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Jordan Stark"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Miss Inger Bruen"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Ms. Kimberli Morissette"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Russel Shields"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Selina Kris MD"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Shirlene Pfannerstill"
  },
  {
    "id": null,
    "author": "Stephen King"
  }
]
```

If by any chance `type` is replaced by another parameter not between `[author, genre, publisher]` the response will be:
```json
{
  "message": "this is not a valid type. Valid types are: [\"author\", \"genre\", \"publisher\"], your type was 'title'",
  "status": 400
}
```

### List books grouped by author, genre or publisher
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/groupBy/type/name
```
To recover all books of a certain **author, genre or publisher** the `type` in the URI must be replaced by one of `[author, genre, publisher]` and the `name` parameter replaced by the **name** of the **author, genre or publisher**. If the name parameter has **more than one word**, the spaces between words should be replaced by an underline, for example if the author name is **"Douglas Adams"** you should write as `Douglas_Adams`.
Example:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/groupBy/author/Stephen_King
```
the response will be a list of books wich Stephen King is the author:

```json

  }
]
```

If an invalid name is requested, the response is:

```json
{
  "message": "type with name:'invalid name' not found. Please check your writing or the word used.",
  "status": "not_found"
}
```
Where 'type' is the `type` parameter and `'invalid name'` the invalid requested name.
For example, if the request is:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/groupBy/author/King_Stephen
```
Then the message would be:
```json
{
  "message": "author with name:'King Stephen' not found. Please check your writing or the word used.",
  "status": "not_found"
}
```

This is valid for genre and publisher as well.
